from Arthur:  I forked this just to strip down Nyr's script a bit, and modify for my own purposes.  I don't use it anymore since I switched to Wireguard for VPN.

**New: Nyr's [wireguard-install](https://github.com/Nyr/wireguard-install) is also available.**

## openvpn-install
OpenVPN [road warrior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_warrior_%28computing%29) installer for Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora.

This script will let you set up your own VPN server in no more than a minute, even if you haven't used OpenVPN before. It has been designed to be as unobtrusive and universal as possible.
